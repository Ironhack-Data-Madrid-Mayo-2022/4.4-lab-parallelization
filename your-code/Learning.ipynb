    "Lesson Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understand the concepts of sequential vs. parallel processing.\n",
    "    Introduce the Python multiprocessing library.\n",
    "    Produce examples of sequential and parallel processing.\n",
    "    Compare performance results and observe how much faster processes finish with multiprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When working as a data analyst or data scientist, there will be times where you will have to apply the same function or operation to a large number of items. By default, Python processes each task you tell it to perform sequentially, which can take a substantial amount of time when either the number of tasks is large, the number of items on which you need to perform the task is large, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the information you need to compute upon is large or the computation is complex, your program can take a long time to run. In cases like these, it is often useful to divide the work among the computing resources available on your machine. This is known as multiprocessing or parallelization, and it can save you significant amounts of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelization refers to the act of performing tasks in parallel. This is made possible by the existence of multiple CPUs or cores on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a multiprocessing library that allows you to spread the work your programs need to perform over the number of cores your machine has. In this lesson, we will learn how to parallelize our code using the multiprocessing library. Along the way, we will practice parallelizing via a variety of examples. Let's go ahead and import it so that it's ready to be used. \n"

    "The multiprocessing library contains several tools for parallelizing your workflow, but the most commonly used is the Pool.map method. Just like the regular map function in Python, Pool.map applies a given function to an iterable such as a list or tuple. However, the main difference is that it does so in parallel. It is relatively straightforward to understand and should work for the majority of cases where you will need parallelization, so we will be focusing on this aspect of the multiprocessing library in this lesson.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",

    "# Sequential Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform a series of tasks in Python, it will execute them sequentially, or one at a time. When a task is performed this way, a subsequent computation does not occur until the one before it is complete.\n",

    "Sequential Processing\n",

    "In this example, Python applied the function to each list element sequentially. In other words, first it squared 0, then it squared 1, then it squared 2, etc. It took a total of 293 milliseconds to run through the list squaring each number and then printing then printing the entire list.\n",

    "If we wanted to speed up the squaring of these numbers, we could parallelize the operation. Doing so would split the job we have to do across the number of cores our machine has (ex. 4 cores) and assign each core a task that it would perform at the same time as the other cores.\n",

    "To do this in Python, all we would have to do is call the Pool class from the multiprocessing library and then simply map the function to the data. This would apply the function in a parallel fashion across however many cores your computer has at a time. Once that has happened, we call the terminate method to stop and shutdown the job and then the join method to prevent any \"zombie\" processes that may result from a child process continuing after a parent process has terminated.\n",
